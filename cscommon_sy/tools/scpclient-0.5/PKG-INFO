Description: ---------
        scpclient
        ---------
        
        A library that implements the client side of the scp (Secure Copy)
        protocol. It is designed to be used with paramiko
        (http://www.lag.net/paramiko/).
        
        Using paramiko
        ==============
        
        There are many ways to use paramiko. For the purposes of these
        examples, you want to obtain an authenticated SSHClient object::
        
            import paramiko
        
            ssh_client = paramiko.SSHClient()
            ssh_client.connect(hostname, username=username, key_filename=key_filename, password=password)
        
        Writing files
        =============
        
        The scpclient.Write object is used to write files to an scp
        server. Its required parameters are a paramiko.SSHClient instance and
        a remote directory name. It has 2 methods: send_file and
        send. send_file takes a filename to send, send takes a file-like
        object, a remote filename, a mode, and a length. You may call send and
        send_file multiple times.
        
        Example::
        
            with closing(Write(ssh_client.get_transport(), '.')) as scp:
                scp.send_file('file.txt', True)
                scp.send_file('../../test.log', remote_filename='baz.log')
        
                s = StringIO('this is a test')
                scp.send(s, 'test', '0601', len(s.getvalue()))
        
        Writing directories
        ===================
        
        Example::
        
            with closing(WriteDir(ssh_client.get_transport(), 'subdir')) as scp:
                scp.send_dir('../../manuals', preserve_times=True, progress=progress)
        
        Reading files
        =============
        
        Example::
        
            with closing(ReadDir(ssh_client.get_transport(), '.')) as scp:
                scp.receive_dir('foo', preserve_times=True)
        
        Reading directories
        ===================
        
        Example::
        
            with closing(Read(ssh_client.get_transport(), '.')) as scp:
                scp.receive('file.txt')

        0.5 2014-04-27 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        * Fixed issue #5, Not all files included in sdist.
        * Fixed issue #6, Rename bdist RPM to python-scpclient.
        * No code changes.
        
        0.4 2012-11-28 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        * Fixed issue #2, Missing contextlib import. Thanks Olivier CARRERE.
        
        0.3 2011-10-31 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        * Improved documentation, including how to create a paramiko
          connection.
        
        0.2 2011-10-31 Eric V. Smith
        ----------------------------
        * Removed useless tests.
        * Fixed embarassing last minute typo which broke the code.
        * Included trivial examples in README.txt. Needs much work.
        * Forbid files that contain '..' in the filename. This is an attempt
          to prevent path traversal. This approach is simplistic, but it's a
          reasonable first step and gets the job done.
